        <h3>Who is Anita Magsaysay-Ho?</h3>
        <p>
          Anita Magsaysay-Ho, born on May 25, 1914, in Manila, Philippines, was a Filipino painter best
          known for her Social Realist and post-Cubist depictions of Filipino life and culture, particularly
          depicting women engaged in labor. Her work focused on the key concepts of Modernism, earning her a
          spot in the Filipino artist group the Thirteen Modernsâ€”the only woman to do so. Magsaysay-Ho gained
          widespread critical acclaim and recognition for her art prior to her death on May 5, 2012, including
          first prize at the Philippine Art Association in 1952.

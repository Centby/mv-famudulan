        Valorant, a team-based tactical shooter by Riot Games, combines elements of games like Counter-Strike with
        character abilities reminiscent of Apex Legends and Overwatch. Matches involve two teams of five players facing
        off on various maps, each with unique layouts. One team attacks by planting a bomb, while the other defends.
        Teams switch sides every 12 rounds, aiming to win by securing 13 rounds, with a two-round advantage required in
        competitive mode. Additional modes like free-for-all deathmatch offer practice opportunities with different
        weapons.
